## Description 
Habit Tracker is a way to hold yourself accountable for good habits every day. In the book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg says that each habit has a cue, routine, and a reward. 
Good habits like exercising, eating healthy, and reading are hard to keep because there is no short-term reward. 
However, with Habit Tracker, the score that you give yourself on these activities could be the reward, and checking the app could be the cue. You decide what the routine is. By scoring yourself, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you are on the path to achieving your goals. 
If you are incentivized to do healthy habits every day, you will become succesful.
A daily habit can be done to varying degrees of success, which is why you can give yourself a score out of 10. Let's use excerise as an example.
Say you only went for a short walk - that's a 3. Or if you ran 5km, that would be a 10. The point is that on the hard days, at least you did a little bit. 
The key to keeping a habit is doing at least a little bit every day.

## Usage
An inspirational quote is displayed on the header, to be further motivate the user. In the add activity box, the user can enter what habit they want to keep track of that day, a description for what they did, and how they rate themselves on that habit. When they click add activity, then the activity is added to the roster of activities for the day. When they click save activities, then the daily score is displayed and saved to local storage, in the records section.
